# Object-oriented Programming
This repository serves as a thorough record of my accomplishments and coursework throughout the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) subject.

# What will you learn in this repository?
Understand the core principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance,
encapsulation, and polymorphism. Learn how to create and manipulate objects, and design classes for maximum reusability and maintainability.

# This repository contains the following Java program/projects
__1. FileHandling Project__
- A Java program handling user input for division, incorporating exception handling.
- Includes a login system with exception handling for login attempts.

__2. HashMap_OOP Project__
- Utilizes OOP principles to represent and process data on departments, employees, and salaries.
- Illustrates fundamental OOP concepts through Java programming.

__3. Object_OrientedProgramming Project__
- Demonstrates an appliance management system using an abstract class (Appliance) and three concrete classes (ElectricFan, Tv, Printer).
- Well-structured program providing a clear demonstration of OOP principles in Java.

__4. OOP_Aggregation Project__
- Illustrates the concept of aggregation in OOP, specifically the "has-a" relationship between classes.

__5. OOP_HashMap Project__
- A simple example of OOP in Java, modeling a scenario involving advisers, students, and block sections.

__6. OOP_Interface Project__
- Demonstrates good use of interfaces and encapsulation, following OOP principles.
- Showcases the use of interfaces for defining common behavior across different classes.
- Demonstrates polymorphism by assigning instances of different appliance classes to a common Switch interface reference.

__7. OOPGameApp Project__
- Java project showcasing the use of interfaces in a game application.
- Demonstrates good usage of interfaces and adherence to object-oriented principles.
